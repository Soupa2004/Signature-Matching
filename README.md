# Signature-Matching
This project is a Flask-based web application designed to detect image forgery by comparing two uploaded images. Users can upload any two images—such as documents, signatures, or scanned IDs—and the application will analyze them using multiple computer vision techniques to determine their similarity. The core functionality is built on top of OpenCV, scikit-image, and Flask for web deployment, allowing for an intuitive interface and fast server-side processing.

Internally, the application preprocesses each image by converting it to grayscale, resizing, binarizing, and cropping it to remove unnecessary background. It then aligns the two images using ORB keypoint detection and homography transformation to correct for perspective mismatches. The similarity between the aligned images is calculated using three methods: Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for layout resemblance, SIFT keypoint matching for visual feature alignment, and histogram comparison for pixel-level intensity distribution. These scores are combined using weighted averaging to compute a final similarity score.

The app categorizes the result into three classifications based on the score: "Genuine" for high similarity, "Possibly Genuine" for moderate similarity, and "Likely Forged" for low similarity. Keypoint visualization is also generated and displayed, offering a transparent look into the comparison process. This system is useful in fields like document verification, fraud detection, and visual plagiarism checking, and can be extended to include advanced models or stored result history in future iterations.
